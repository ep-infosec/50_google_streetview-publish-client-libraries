# Client libraries for the Google Street View Publish API

The [Street View Publish API](http://developers.google.com/streetview/publish)
allows your application to publish 360 photos to Google Maps, along with image
metadata that specifies the position, orientation, and connectivity of each
photo. With this API, any app can offer an interface for positioning,
connecting, and uploading user-generated Street View images.

This library provides code to call this API from several languages including Java, JavaScript, and python.
Please see the [documentation](https://developers.google.com/streetview/publish/libraries)
